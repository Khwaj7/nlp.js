# Connectors

Connectors are components that are used to handle th communication between the bot and the outside world. For instance,
some of them may provide a command-line tool to send and receive messages with the user, or may expose some endpoints
int an HTTP server to handle incoming requests, but also being able to send requests if necessary.

Currently, the following out of the box connectors are available:

- [Console connector](./console-connector)

- DialogFlow connector

- [Directline connector](./directline-connector)

- [Facebook Messenger connector](./fb-connector)

- [MSBF connector](./msbf-connector)

- [REST connector](./rest-connector)

- Test connector

Of course, you can also develop your own [custom connector](./custom_connectors)

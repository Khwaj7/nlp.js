# The _None_ intent

There is the posibility to configure the neural network to avoid false positives. To achieve that, one of the internal mechanisms
is that words never seen by the network are represented as a feature that gives some weight to the `None` intent. So, if you try
to classify a phrase that matches no intent, it will return the `None`intent.

If you feel more comfortable with classifications into the intents that you declare, then you can disable this behavior by setting
the `useNoneFeature` to false:

```javascript
const manager = new NlpManager({
  languages: ["en"],
  nlu: { useNoneFeature: <b>false</b> },
});
```

On the other hand, if you prefer to avoid those false positives, don't forget to enable the _useNoneFeature_:

```javascript
const manager = new NlpManager({
  languages: ["en"],
  nlu: { useNoneFeature: true },
});
```

::: info

Note that the _None_ intent feature is disabled by default

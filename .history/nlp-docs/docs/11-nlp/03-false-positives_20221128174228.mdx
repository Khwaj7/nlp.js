# The <i>None</i> intent

By default, the neural network tries to avoid false positives. To achieve that, one of the internal processes is that words never seen by the network are represented as a feature that gives some weight to the `None` intent. So, if you try the previous example with "_I have to go_" it will return the `None` intent because 2 of the 4 words have never been seen while training.
If you don't want to avoid those false positives, and you feel more comfortable with classifications into the intents that you declare, then you can disable this behavior by setting the `useNoneFeature` to false:

```javascript
const manager = new NlpManager({
  languages: ["en"],
  nlu: { useNoneFeature: false },
});
```
